        <h2>Background</h2>
			<p>As a touring musician for the past 20+ years with a lifelong fascination with 
			technology and design, I have repeatedly come back to Graphic Design and Web Development, 
			doing small projects in my down time, with an interest in pursuing this as a full time career. 
			My other passions include coffee, hiking, video games, and most of all, spending as much time as I can with my wife and son. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I have always had a passion with technology and design. When I am not doing this I love 
			to drink coffee, get out into nature, play video games, and most of all spend as much time as I can
			with my amazing family.
